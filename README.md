# FUWAMOCO Hyprland Cursors

FUWAMOCO themed cursors for Hyprland

## DISCLAIMER

**I did not make the images for these cursors. These cursors were made by くれま on pixiv. Link to the original cursors: https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/110462961**

The original cursors are Windows-only cursors. I merely ported them over to Hyprland cursors (`.hlc`).

## Usage

Download the pre-built zips from the latest release and extract to `~/.icons`. Then in your Hyprland configuration, add (or change your existing cursor config to) `exec-once = hyprctl setcursor <cursor_name> <size>`.

Cursor name refers to which version you want (FuwaCursor, MocoCursor, or FWMCCursor).

Size refers to the size of the cursor, either 24, 32, 48, or 64 are provided. (Original size is 64x64 so quality might've suffered in resizing)
